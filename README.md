sim-cyborg
==========

A final year group project for the D-Cyborg Team

To run, execute ./start_server.sh in the root directory. The main project page can then be accessed in a web browser at "localhost:3000"

NB. There may be a bug on some linux installations where forever cannot find nodejs. This can be worked around by running 'nodejs server.js'

###Config

Global variables which are not typically changed from game to game are stored in Sim/data/config_file.json. 

###Requires:
* node.js - Web server

(Development carried out using nodejs v0.10.15)

###Requires node packages:
* express - Web application framework
* forever - Keep a script running continually

###Installing Dependencies
* node.js - http://nodejs.org/
* express - Use npm (https://www.npmjs.org/) npm install express
* forever - npm install forever

###To Run tests:
Open localhost:3000/SpecRunner.html in a browser and the results of all present tests will be displayed on the screen. Source code is found in /src and the specifications for the tests themselves are found in /spec.


###List of Features and their usage:
* Process Simulator: This runs in the background and controls all development and progress on modules, this can be viewed whenever a scenario is selected. Sites and time progress, which drives the other features. Sites also only work for 8 hours a day (this can be changed in the master config), within their own appropriate timezone.
* Default Scenarios: These are presented to the user once the application is loaded, and allow for an easy setup for predefined scenarios that show off the application without any user input immediately required.
* Problem Simulator and Intervention interface: The problem simulator and intervention interface are closely tied together, and as a result fall under the same heading - problems are generated by the simulation and added to a site, which then allows notifications for the intervention interface to be displayed on the frontend. A list of interventions is then displayed to the user, none of which have an immediate impact but will reduce the probability of further problems of the same domain reoccuring.
* Status Display: Each site has a traffic light style status update which changes colour based on progress, and also displays basic information about each site.
* Inquiry Interface: The inquiry interface is a series of options, on a per site basis, which allow the user to explore a site in detail, to effectively decide if a site is accurately reporting their progress. Each option has an associated cost.
* Cultural Influenced Reporting: Not every site will report information accurately, based on cultural influences predefined by the literature in the backlog. This can be seen when an asian site is reporting all green, and the user visits to see that the site may not actually be on track with it's progress.
* End of Game Report: Score is calculated based on the formula given in the backlog, and displayed at the end of the game. This report also records other metrics such as revenue and productivity etc etc.
* Schedule Calculator: Used in the end of game report. Is just thge sum of all the efforts estimated for each module defined by an effort value defined in the master config.
* Site Morale: Each site has a morale value which reflects how motivated the site is. The player can do things such as hold a party or organise a fun office excursion to increase a site's morale. However, repeated use of such activities will render them less effective at boosting morale. Morale is lost when problems occur and money is spent to correct them, tiring out the site. Morale is directly linked to a site's productivity. If a site is at 80% morale then it will work at 80% of its normal speed. Alernatively, if a site's morale is at 120% then it will work 20% faster than normal. In addition, the morale of a site changes every day by +/- 1 to reflect the changing mood of an office day to day.

###Master Config:
Edit this at /Sim/Data/config_file.json
Values & Definitions for Global, Temporal and Cultural Distance were taken from http://jnoll.nfshost.com/cs4098/projects/global_distance.html
* Global Distances: Defines geographical distance between home site and other sites.
* Temporal Distances: Defines time difference between home site and other sites.
* Cultural Distances: Defines cultural differences between home site and other sites.
* Revenue: Revenue per year.
* Starting Capital: The amount of money the player starts with.
* Developer Effort: How many effort points a developer delivers per working hour
* Developer Rate: The cost per hour a developer incurs.
* Developer Working Hours: Hours a day the developer will work.
* Problem Constant: Constant value for problem simulator, used to tweak difficulty, decrease to reduce frequenecy of problems.
* Moral Modifer: Determines how quickly a moral intervention's impact errodes after repeated use. The higher the value, the quicker the errosion.
* Interventions: Initial and Daily cost for interventions, and the tasks they will affect. The numbers 0-6 represent the 7 stages of the product's lifecycle. Is_Implemented is the initial state of the intervention, if the user has paid for it, or simply starts with it.
